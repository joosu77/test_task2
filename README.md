# Task description
You are given a large image (`large.bmp`) and a video as a series of zoomed in images (in `zoomed` folder named by their timestamps). The zoomed in video moves around throughout the large image area. Write a python code that outputs a set of coordinates for each zoomed frame which correspond to the location of the frame centerpoint within the large image in pixel coordinates.
# Notes
* Looking into the future is not allowed, for any frame in the zoomed directory you can use information from the preceeding frames but not the following ones
* Also measure how much time the code takes and try to optimize it
* To submit a solution fork this repo, make it private, add the solution and invite me to the repo
