# Task description
You are given a large image (`large.bmp`) and a video as a series of zoomed in images (in `zoomed.zip` named by their timestamps). The zoomed in video moves around throughout the large image area. Write a python code that creates a video which is the large image with a box that shows where the zoomed in image is looking at each frame.
# Notes
* Also measure how much time the code takes and try to optimize it
* `zoomed.zip` is stored using lfs so git lfs needs to be installed to clone the whole repo
